## Early Modern Messengers
Early Modern Messengers represents of 1243 messengers and postal officials from the 12th through 18th centuries. I assembled this prosopography in the course of my book research from 2016-2025. Areas of special focus include the Venetian Company of Couriers and the Tassis family, however individual entries span Europe and the British Isles.

### Top 5 Office Associations:

| Tuscan Couriers  | 99  |
| Spanish Post of Milan  | 81  |
| Papal Cursores  | 63  |

Sources include a wide variety of secondary scholarship in English, German, and Italian as well as primary sources from state archives. A reference is provided for each individual.

Some sources have allowed for additional family relationships, particularly within the Tassis Family and the Venetian Company of Couriers. These have been tidied in preparation for network analysis, but would require further disambiguation by unique identifier for full accuracy.
